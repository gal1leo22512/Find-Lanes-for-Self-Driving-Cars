# Find Lanes for Self Driving Cars
lane-detection algorithm

expected result ---> https://imgur.com/gallery/6ZdbWSy

You should run the FindLanes.py and should change the region of interest depending on your video or image, but if you will not use another image or video do not change anything



Feel free to change or play with my program! :D

happy coding
